Video game news resource gatherer


Reason - New games get announced all the time.  Sometime their release dates and relevant gameplay is shown along side.  Other times we have to wait for months if not years from the first teaser.  This site is built to make it easy to follow, or watch, games from reveal to release.  It will be a concise place to find a games information and news.

* How to gather this information?
   *  Automatic web listeners? 
   * Or actual human “field agents”?
